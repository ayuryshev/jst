# Frontend self-education

## WTF

It's a collection of small projects, every one exploring 
just one problem. 

Points of interest: 
* react and react components (and vue.js later, `view` in general )
* redux (state management in general)
* `bulma`, `bootstrap` and other ~~cancer~~css-frameworks
* "anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity"  

So far every project is started by `create-react-app`.

## TODO 

Write description for each project.

### r01-eject

`create-react-app` and `yarn eject`
